This program is a client that captures images from the Raspberyy Pi camera, and sends those images to a server who
does image processing and sends back the result to the client.

TODO:
- Add CAN output of the received data. See https://libbits.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/socketcan-support-in-python/ or http://elinux.org/Python_Can.
- Start capturing the next image as soon as possible, even if the result from the previous one has not yet been received.

This code is based on: http://picamera.readthedocs.org/en/release-1.9/recipes1.html#capturing-to-a-network-stream
It is intended to run on the Raspberry Pi.

Installation instructions:
- Update the firmware to the latest version
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
- Reboot
- Install Python 3, if not already present:
$ sudo apt-get install python3
- Get the Python 3 package manager:
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
- Install camera software: 
$ pip-3.2 install --user picamera
$ sudo apt-get install python3-picamera
- Install other libraries:
$ sudo pip-3.2 install requests
- Enable the camera:
$ sudo raspi-config
Then select enable camera from the menu
- Run the program (specifying a map as argument, which is optional; add "&" if running from a script):
$ python3 OptiposRPiClient.py SSECorridorMap.json

To make optipos start when booting the RPi, do the following (see http://www.stuffaboutcode.com/2012/06/raspberry-pi-run-program-at-start-up.html):
- Create a file called /etc/init.d/optipos (note that this file has to be edited as sudo).
- The contents of the file should be:
#! /bin/sh
# /etc/init.d/optipos

### BEGIN INIT INFO
# Provides:          optipos
# Required-Start:    $all
# Required-Stop:
# Default-Start:     2 3 4 5
# Default-Stop:      0 1 6
# Short-Description: Start optipos on boot
# Description:       Start optipos on boot
### END INIT INFO

# If you want a command to always run, put it here

# Carry out specific functions when asked to by the system
case "$1" in
  start)
    echo "Starting optipos"
    # run application you want to start
    cd /home/pi/Optipos
    python3 OptiposRPiClient.py SSECorridorMap.txt > optipos-trace.txt 2>&1
    ;;
  stop)
    echo "Stopping optipos"
    # kill application you want to stop
    ;;
  *)
    echo "Usage: /etc/init.d/optipos {start|stop}"
    exit 1
    ;;
esac

exit 0

- Make the script executable:
$ sudo chmod 755 /etc/init.d/
- Register the script to be run at start-up:
$ sudo update-rc.d optipos defaults
- Reboot

If the script needs to be removed from the boot sequence:
$ sudo update-rc.d -f  optipos remove
